Some modules are now getting imported due to import error.
Snake case (ex: snake_case) is commonly used in scripting languages like Python. It is showing an error because the variable name is not following the snake case as variable name length is less than 3 symbols.
Too many local variables: This error is shown as an indicator that the function or method is too complex, or trying to do too much.
Also it shows how to use f-string for formatting a regular string.
C0103: Variable name “temp_whitelist_channle_id” does not conform to UPPER_CASE naming style (invalid naming):  As your code is not contained in a class or function it is expecting those variables to be constants and as such they should be uppercase.
